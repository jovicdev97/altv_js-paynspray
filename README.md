this is not finished as I plan to add animations and improve immersion

Installation
Download and place the folder with the script files inside your /resources folder.
Edit your server.toml to include the folder name of the script in the resources list.
Example server.toml:
resources = ['chat', 'freeroam', 'startupscript', 'car-spawner', 'npc-para', 'YOUR-FOLDER-NAME']
Replace YOUR-FOLDER-NAME with the actual name of the script folder.
